Instructions
------------

1) Install Oracle JDK 12 or OpenJDK 12 

1) Download the JavaFX 12.0.1 SDK from the following URL (https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) with the SDK download depending on your operating system.

2) Unzip the downloaded file and ensure the unzipped directory is named 'javafx-sdk-12.0.1'.

3) Place the directory ('javafx-sdk-12.0.1') directly in the 'Sources Files' directory. Consequently, the 'Source Files' folder should contain two subfolders ('src' and 'javafx-sdk-12.0.1').

4) Execute run.sh.

Tested on the following Operating Systems
-----------------------------------------

Mac OS Catalina 10.15 Oracle JDK 12
Ubuntu 18.04 Open JDK 12 

Additional Directories
----------------------

The "Source Files" directory was made so the "src' folder and the "javafx-sdk-12.0.1" directories could be at the same level while keeping the root of the project clean.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If run.sh is not executable, move into the directory in which it is placed and run
the following command. 'chmod +x run.sh'
